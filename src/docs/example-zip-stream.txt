\page example2 Example: Loading images directly from a zip file

	This example shows you how you can use TinyImageLoader, zlib and libzip to
	load an image directly from a zip archive.
	
	Refer to \ref example1 for an example of how to load an image the normal
	way.

\section intro Introduction

	Zip archives behave like a miniature filesystem. It has a root, a number of
	folders and number of files. TinyImageLoader exposes its file loading
	interface through the #til::FileStream interface.

\section notes Notes

	When extending the FileStream interface, you must take care of the following
	things:

	- Make sure the m_FilePath variable contains a valid path to the file you're
	loading
	- Handle both #TIL_FILE_ABSOLUTEPATH and #TIL_FILE_ADDWORKINGDIR or ignore
	it altogether
	- Implement all the reading functions (#til::FileStream::Read,
	#til::FileStream::ReadByte, #til::FileStream::ReadWord,
	#til::FileStream::ReadDWord)
	- Return at least false on #til::FileStream::EndOfFile
	- Implement #til::FileStream::IsReusable
	- Close the stream neatly in #til::FileStream::Close
	
\section code Code

	Reading directly from a zip archive means we have to open a handle to the
	archive, find the file we want to load and unpack it on the fly.

	We'll start by creating a child class of #til::FileStream called
	FileStreamZip.
	
	\code
	class FileStreamZip : public til::FileStream
	{
	\endcode
	
	In the constructor we'll set up some stuff, including the maximum buffer
	size, and alloate the buffer.
