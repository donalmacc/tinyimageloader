	TinyImageLoader wouldn't exist without the people writing specifications,
	open source implementations and use cases. This page is to thank them.
	
\section png PNG

    This PNG loader is entirely based on the works of Sean Barrett a.k.a. nothings.
	You can download the original stb_image.c from his website at http://www.nothings.org/stb_image.c

	stb_image is a legendary compact file loader that implements multiple file
	formats in a single C file. It does so in an opaque, but easy to use way.

	The original idea for TinyImageLoader came from reimplementing stb_image.c
	in such a way that it would be readable to me. When I was done I started
	implementing other formats as well. Without stb_image, no TinyImageLoader.

	What I changed:
	* Support for different color depths
	* Added Animated PNG support

	Everything else is Mr. Barrett's code implemented in a different manner.
	
\section gif GIF

	I took this code almost verbatim from a folder I found at Breakpoint 2010.
	You see, one of the patrons was kind enough to set up an FTP server. What
	he put up there was a folder called 'coding'. This turned out to be treasure
	trove of old, old code. The year of writing is 2010, and the code dates from
	early 1993 to 2004. Old stuff. Ancient stuff. As it turns out, so is the
	.gif file format.

	In the folder "Demo tools" was a folder inconspicuously named
	"Neon 08.11.2004". In there, in Old\Despair, I found PIX.C. Which had a
	complete GIF loader! Like I said, the code was taken almost verbatim. Even
	though it was demoscene code and almost two decades old, it worked very
	well.

	I hacked animated GIF's in it myself.

	Something to think about: when PIX.C was written, Netscape hadn't even
	written their extension yet! .GIF's didn't support animation back then!

	My salutations go to you, Mr. Javier Baeza, may your code live forever.
	
\section dds DDS

	My implementation of the DDS loader is based on the specifications set out
	by the OpenGL standards board. You can find it here:

	http://www.opengl.org/registry/specs/EXT/texture_compression_s3tc.txt

	It describes in clear language the different compression techniques employed
	by DDS. It was very useful for figuring out how to decompress them.

	The basis for the loader is formed by code given to me by a colleague who
	calls himself Seniltai. For his game, he implemented a DDS loader, but he
	didn't bother decompiling the images by hand.
