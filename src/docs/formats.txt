\page formats Supported formats

	TinyImageLoader supports the following formats.
	
\section png PNG

	- 32-bit images
	- Images with multiple IDAT chunks
	- APNG (animated PNG), a Mozilla extension
	- Images with both an IDAT chunk and APNG data

	The full APNG specification is not yet implemented. There will be APNG
	images that won't load correctly.
	
\section bmp BMP

	- Windows v3 header
	- Uncompressed RGB images
	
	There are many more options, but these are by far the most common one.
	If you want compression, you won't use a BMP. That seems to be the general
	consensus.
	
\section tga TGA

	- Uncompressed images
	- Run-length encoded images
	
	TGA also supports palettized and black and white images, but I've never seen
	them in the wild.
	
\section gif GIF

	- Palettized 256-color images
	- Old GIF standard (GIF87A)
	- New GIF standard (GIF89A)
	- Animated GIF's
	
	TinyImageLoader implements the entire GIF specification.
	Small spec, but limited in its usefulness.
	
\section ico ICO

	- Palettized images with 16 colors
	- Palettized images with 256 colors
	- Uncompressed RGBA images
	- Unoompressed RGB images
	- PNG-compressed images
	
	The ICO standards are incomplete and full of gotcha's. Some images still
	won't load fully.

\section dds DDS

	- Uncompressed images
	- DXT1 compressed images
	- DXT5 compressed images
	- Levels of detail (mipmaps)
	- Cubemaps
	
	There are many, many ways to compress DDS textures. TinyImageLoader will
	one day support them all, but for now the most common types are fine.
