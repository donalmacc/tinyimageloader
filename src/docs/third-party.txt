\page thirdparty Third-party libraries

	TinyImageLoader itself doesn't require any third-party libraries. However, if you
	want to run the examples, some setup is required.

\section OpenGL

	The headers for OpenGL are already supplied. However, make sure your system
	contains a copy of OpenGL32.lib. If you have Visual Studio installed this
	shouldn't be a problem.

\section GLEW

	GLEW is used by the Framework to open an OpenGL window.
	
	Download GLEW from their website:
	
	http://glew.sourceforge.net/
	Direct link: http://sourceforge.net/projects/glew/files/glew/1.5.8/glew-1.5.8-win32.zip/download
	
	- Extract the archive to third-party\\GLEW
	
	TinyImageLoader has been tested against GLEW 1.5.7.
	
\section ZLib

	ZLib is used by the ZIP archive example to extract a ZIP archive. It isn't
	a requirement for the simple viewer example.
	
	Download ZLib from their website:
	
	http://zlib.net/
	Direct link: http://zlib.net/zlib-1.2.5.tar.gz
	
	- Extract the archive to third-party\\ZLib
	- Run CMake to generate a Visual Studio project
	- Compile for both Debug and Release
	- Go into the Debug folder (third-party\\ZLib\\Debug) and copy zlib1d.dll to TinyImageLoader's bin folder
	- Go into the Release folder (third-party\\ZLib\\Release) and copy zlib1.dll to TinyImageLoader's bin folder
	
	TinyImageLoader has been tested against ZLib 1.2.5.
	
\section UnZip

	Unzip is a wrapper for ZLib to make it easier to load ZIP archives. It isn't
	a requirement for the simple viewer example.
	
	Download UnZip from their website:
	
	http://www.winimage.com/zLibDll/minizip.html
	Direct link: http://www.winimage.com/zLibDll/unzip101h.zip
	
	- Extract the archive to third-party\\UnZip
	- Load the provided solution file in Visual Studio (third-party\\UnZip\\UnZip101.sln)
	- Compile for both Debug and Release
	
	TinyImageLoader has been tested against UnZip 1.0.1.
