--== Linking against UnZip ==--

First, you need to download ZLib from their website:

http://zlib.net/
Direct link: http://zlib.net/zlib-1.2.5.tar.gz

Extract the archive to third-party\ZLib.

Next, you will need unzip101:

http://www.winimage.com/zLibDll/minizip.html
Direct link: http://www.winimage.com/zLibDll/unzip101h.zip

Extract the archive to third-party\UnZip

Load the premade solution file in Visual Studio and compile for both Debug and
Release.

Congratulations!

You can now link against UnZip. :)
